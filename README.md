#  Fractional Fourier Transform in Time Series Prediction

This is the GitHub repository for the paper: E.Koc,  A. Koç, **“ Fractional Fourier Transform in Time Series Prediction ”** submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 2022. In this study, we apply a window function a univariate time series and divide it into segment. Then, we apply fractional Fourier transform on each segment and obtain feature vectors. These feature vectors are fed into GRU/RNN based encoder-decoder to predict the future time series. This repository is benefited from the codes in the paper Sequence Prediction using Spectral RNNs and modified the codes depending on the tasks. Codes are implemented using Tensorflow 1.15 (1.1x is also suitable )on Linux based systems
