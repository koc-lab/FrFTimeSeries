#  Fractional Fourier Transform in Time Series Prediction

This is the GitHub repository for the paper: E.Koc,  A. Koç, **“ Fractional Fourier Transform in Time Series Prediction ”** submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 2022. In this study, we apply a window function a univariate time series and divide it into segment. Then, we apply fractional Fourier transform on each segment and obtain feature vectors. These feature vectors are fed into GRU/RNN based encoder-decoder to predict the future time series. This repository is benefited from the codes in the paper [Sequence Prediction using Spectral RNNs](https://github.com/v0lta/Spectral-RNN) and modified the codes depending on the tasks. Codes are implemented using Tensorflow 1.15 (1.1x is also suitable )on Linux based systems
